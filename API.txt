API (Application Programming interface)

=> It is no way related to java meaning, it is used having english
     meaning like- base, platform and etc..


=> API is base for the programmers to develop software apps..
   every programming language, s/w technology and framework provides
   API.

=> In "C" language API means set of functions that comes in the form
   of "header files" (.h files).


=> In "C++" language API means set of functions and classes that 
   comes in the form of "header files".

=> In "Java" language API means set of classes, interface, enums,
   annotations which comes in the form of packages...









How many types of APIs do we have?






















3 types of APIs
===============

1) Pre-defined APIs/Built-in APIs

   --> It will come along with software(JDK).

2) User-defined APIS

    ---> Developed by the programmers

3) Third party APIS

    --> Given by Third party vendors like-- java zoom, softwareTree,
         Apache and etc.....


  (Here party1 ---> Programmer/Developer

        party2 ----> The s/w vendor company who is giving software language
                     ,technology, framework.


1) Examples java pre-defined apis
=================================
cmd>javap java.lang.Object

javap => , here p stands profile.

 and whereas java is a main package

  and, lang is a sub-package

   and, Object is a pre defined class.

utility api --> java.util and its sub packages..
networking api --> java.reflect and its sub packages..
jdbc api (technology) ---> java.sql, javax.sql and its sub packages..
servlet api ------->       javax.servlet and its sub packages
hibernate api(framework) ----> org.hibernate and its sub packages...


=> In APplication Development we can use all 3 types of apis...

=> set of apis together is called Library.. and these libraries in 
   java will come as jar files...
